This branch contains scripts used for testing.

`HeatingSystem_Only`: Otter code used for testing heating system. UI code is not
initialized, so the bassinet does not have to wait for user input/control.
`new_Thermistor_Rig`: Otter firmware code to obtain heating uniformity temperature using thermistor.
